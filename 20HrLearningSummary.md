# Learning a new skill
Here are some points from the TEDtalk "*The First 20 hours*" by **Josh Kaufman**<br>
According to the study by a professor at Florida State University,K. Anders Ericsson it takes 10,000 hrs of regorous practice to master a skill, as there is a saying 
"Practice makes a man perfect".<br>

*But how can we manage to learn anything in our busy schedule?*<br>
Here is a graph illustrating the **learning curve** which shows that it takes a short period of time from knowing nothing to being reasonably good at a skill:

>i.e with a little bit of practice we get really good which is called the the early level of improvement.

### *Learning takes only 20 hours of practice,40 minutes a day for about a month, if we follow these simple tips:*<br>
* **Deconstruct the skill**:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Break the skill apart into smaller pieces,practice the most important ones first to improve performance.<br>
* **Learn enough to self correct**: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Stop procastinating by getting a lot of resources before even starting,instead make use of study material and resources while learning.<br>
* **Remove practice barriers**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Getting rid of distractions and concentrating<br>
* **Practice for atleast 20 hrs**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Making up our mind and actually sitting for 20hrs.<br>


>  The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual - its emotional,the fear or laziness within us in the beginning of learning anything new.<br>


**Hence the will power to learn and manage time wisely should be the motto to acquire a new skill !**
